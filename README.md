Kalah is an oriental game that is traditionally played with stones (if you have them). In this project, you play against the computer. Beware - it is a tough opponent!

This project is an implementation of the well-known algorithm, A* in Prolog. This algorithm aims to avoid the combinatorial search to find the best move.
